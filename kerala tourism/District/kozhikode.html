            <p>Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.</p>
